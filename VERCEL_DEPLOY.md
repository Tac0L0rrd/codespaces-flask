# ðŸš€ Deploy Flask App to Vercel (Netlify Alternative)

## Why Vercel Instead of Netlify?

**Netlify = Static Sites Only**
- HTML, CSS, JS files
- No Python backend support
- No database support

**Vercel = Full-Stack Apps** 
- Python/Flask support âœ…
- Database support âœ…  
- Similar to Netlify workflow âœ…

## Step-by-Step Vercel Deployment

### Step 1: Create vercel.json Configuration
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "app.py",
      "use": "@vercel/python"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "app.py"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 2: Update requirements.txt
Make sure it includes:
```
Flask==2.3.3
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Vercel
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign up with GitHub (just like Netlify!)
3. Click "New Project"
4. Select your `codespaces-flask` repository
5. Vercel auto-detects Python and deploys!

### Step 4: Initialize Demo Data
After deployment, your app will be live with a URL like:
`https://your-app-name.vercel.app`

## Alternative: Add to Your Portfolio as a Case Study

Since your portfolio is on Netlify, you could:

1. **Deploy Flask app to Vercel/Railway**
2. **Add project showcase to your Netlify portfolio**
3. **Link to live demo** from your portfolio

### Portfolio Integration Example:
```html
<div class="project">
  <h3>EduBridge School Management System</h3>
  <p>Full-stack Flask application with role-based authentication...</p>
  <a href="https://your-app.vercel.app">Live Demo</a>
  <a href="https://github.com/Tac0L0rrd/codespaces-flask">Source Code</a>
</div>
```

## Quick Setup Commands

```bash
# Create vercel.json in your project
cd /workspaces/codespaces-flask

# Add the configuration (we'll do this for you)
# Then commit and push

# Deploy at vercel.com
```

**Bottom Line: Vercel is like Netlify but supports Python/Flask! Same easy workflow you're used to.** ðŸš€
