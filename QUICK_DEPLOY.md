### Step 3: Environment Setup
Railway automatically:
- Installs dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- Runs `python app.py`
- Provides a public URL

**Result: Live demo in under 5 minutes!**

## Option 3: Enhanced GitHub README

Instead of screenshots, create sections like:

### 🎯 Key Features
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Admin, Teacher, Student dashboards
- **Grade Management**: Teachers can enter/update student grades
- **Attendance Tracking**: Mark and view attendance records
- **Assignment System**: Create, manage, and track assignments

### 🏗️ Architecture
```
Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS) → Flask Routes → SQLite Database
```

### 🔑 Demo Credentials
- Admin: `admin` / `admin123`
- Teacher: `mr_smith` / `teacher123`  
- Student: `alice_cooper` / `student123`

### 💻 Local Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tac0L0rrd/codespaces-flask.git
cd codespaces-flask
pip install flask
python create_demo_data.py
python app.py
```

## Benefits of Live Deployment vs Screenshots:

| Live Demo | Screenshots |
|-----------|-------------|
| ✅ Interactive testing | ❌ Static images |
| ✅ Shows real functionality | ❌ Limited view |
| ✅ Professional presentation | ❌ Outdated quickly |
| ✅ Impressive to employers | ❌ Less engaging |
| ✅ Share with single link | ❌ Multiple files |

---

**Recommendation: Deploy live to Railway - it's free, fast, and much more impressive than screenshots!**
