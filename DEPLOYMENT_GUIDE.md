# EduBridge Railway Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Quick Deploy to Railway

### Step 1: Prepare Your Repository
```bash
# Make sure all files are committed
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for Railway deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Railway
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign up/login with GitHub
3. Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your `codespaces-flask` repository
5. Railway will auto-detect it's a Python project

### Step 3: Configure Environment
Railway will automatically:
- Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- Run the app using the start command in `railway.json`
- Generate a public URL

### Step 4: Initialize Demo Data
After deployment:
1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Open the "Deployments" tab
3. Click on the latest deployment
4. Open "View Logs" to see if the app started
5. Visit the generated URL

### Environment Variables (if needed)
- `FLASK_ENV=production`
- `PORT=5000` (Railway sets this automatically)

### Expected Result
Your app will be live at: `https://your-project-name.up.railway.app`

## 🌐 Alternative: Render.com

### Step 1: Connect Repository
1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Sign up/login with GitHub
3. Click "New" → "Web Service"
4. Connect your GitHub repository

### Step 2: Configure Web Service
- **Name**: edubridge-school-system
- **Root Directory**: (leave blank)
- **Environment**: Python 3
- **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Start Command**: `python app.py`

### Step 3: Deploy
Render will automatically deploy and provide a URL like:
`https://edubridge-school-system.onrender.com`

## 📱 For Mobile Testing

Add this viewport meta tag to all HTML templates:
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```

## 🔧 Production Considerations

### Security (for real deployment)
- Change the secret key
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Enable HTTPS (automatically handled by Railway/Render)

### Performance
- The current SQLite setup works well for demos
- For production, consider PostgreSQL

### Monitoring
- Both Railway and Render provide logs and metrics
- Set up uptime monitoring if needed
